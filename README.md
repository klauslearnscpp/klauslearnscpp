- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @klauslearnscpp

When I was around 11-12 years old, I used to crack cheats for various games like Wolfteam and Point Blank. I'd swipe the code, change just the names and designs, and claim them as my own. I joined numerous hacking groups and made strides in the hacking world using other people's programs and code, became a retired script kiddie at 13. Now, at 20, I'm chasing my childhood dream of learning C++ and continuing my adventure.
